# CARTOGCOFFEE:
A full stack educational app for coffee production and consumption. 
This is a codeclan project working within a team of 4. My responsibility was the Map functionality, including everything within the black bars (filters etc). MVP and Extensions were decided by our team.

This was created after only one week of learning JavaScript and 2 weeks of React. Including planning and researching react-leaflet, this was completed in 5 days. Although I may clean up some of the dead branches and fix a bug or two in the future I will leave the main branch as is so that it is an accurate reflection of what was achieved within the given time-frame and at the current experience level described earlier.

#MVP:

our app must display educational content regarding coffee:

  - a map API will display points of interest in the 'coffee world', such as countries that are major producers/consumers. 
  - a drop down menu to filter by region 
  - educational tooltips which provide the user with information on coffee from that specific region 
  
#EXTENSIONS:

  - add additional filter criteria
  - zoom to filtered region 
  - include a section on preperation instructions
  - add a choropleth to the map to display coffee production/consumption in each country 
  - additional styling
  
#INSTRUCTIONS:

  -  from CLIENT directory install required packages: npm install 
  -  from SERVER directory install required packages: npm install 
  -  from SERVER directory seed mongodb database: npm run seeds
  -  from SERVER directory spin up the development server: npm run server:dev
  -  from CLIENT directory spin up the react server: npm start 
  -  if this doesnt open your browser automatically, open up a new window on localhost:3000
  -  we recomend CHROME as this is what it was designed in.
